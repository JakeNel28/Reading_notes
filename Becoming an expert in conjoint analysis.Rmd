##Chapter 1 -- How People Choose

In the conditional multinomial logit model (**MNL**), the utility function is a 
simple linear model; the sum of the proudcuts of each of k attributes and their 
utility weights (plus a small error term). Choice probabilities are then modeled 
as the exponentiated utility of said choice alternative divided by the sum of 
the exponentiated utilities of all other alternatives. However, the assumption 
must hold that the ratio of choice probabilities for two alternatives is 
constant (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, or IIA). This is also a type 
of random utility model (RUM), becuase the utility function includes an error 
term.

MNL also assumes that attributes are additive and compensatory. An example model 
that gets around that assumption is most notably the lexicographic choice 
models which models choices by a "drill down by attribute" approach. However, it
is computationally expensive compared to MNL. These and other models that get 
around the compensatory assumption are termed *non-compensatory models*

The field of behavioral economics might also stipulate that choices are not a 
function of utility maximization, but rather regret minimization. With the right
coding, these can still use an MNL engine, and outpredict standard RUM-MNL 
models about half the time.  There are other models in this realm as well, but
none have proven their superiority to RUM-based models.  

In the real world, we adapt our decision models based on the situation. Some 
might be compensatory, some might be lexicographic, some might be satisficing, 
etc. Respondent level utility models help us capture the heterogeneity of 
decision rules. However, because we are adaptive choosers means that we need to 
be careful about hypothetical bias.
